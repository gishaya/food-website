    <h1>WELCOME TO MY HOME PAGE</h1>
    
    <p>Before we proceed let me formally introduce myself. My nake is Grace Ishaya I am an upcoming web developer, I love to code whenever i am less busy I could spend atleast four to five hours of my time coding the web over and over again until i get tired or feel like sleeping</p>
    

    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
<div class="intro">
    <p>We will be discussing on the topic get rich or die trying: In life, we go through ups and down trying to make sure that ends meet,  I could remember when I was growing up I had to stay with my uncle in kaduna, whose name was Mr Ishaya Adamu. He happens to be the elder brother to my mother.<br>
    He had six children their gender were: Male four and Female two. He was a really caring uncle that will not allow anything in the world disturb me Let's kickstart from when I started staying with my ucle in kaduna.
It was as a result of my family issue because my dad was a great brutalist and a woman beater. My dad and mom got married in the year 1988  cannot really place the exact month and date but it was in kano that they started their life as a couple, My dad was always belittling my mum because he feels she was from a poor background and that she has nothing to  offer. <br> my mom will break down into tears whenever he says so. 
he feels she was a liability to him and a full house wife was what he wanted, my mum kept striving and working hard. As an ND meaning a national diploma student from Katsina polytechnic
she got a job and started working as a secretarry in one of those hotel management organizations close to our home, My 
My dad had a car but will not drop her at work despite the fact that was his route to work on daily basis. My  mom had to use public transport everyday from monday to friday. she will drop me in school before going to work because my school was in a close proximity to her office. My dad picks on every little thing he sees and also nags like a woman.<br> he beat her up at least eight to ten times a week.<br>this made life unbearable for her. I became six when she left the house to kaduna we both ran away from the house. he cane begging in my uncles house in kaduna,<br> my uncle left him and refuse to listen to him because he has been receiving series of complaints from him concerning his marriage to his sister.<br> I had to start school in my uncles house in kaduna from primary five to university<br> 
I started working as a sales girl in an electronic shop in kaduna. My boss was a nice person and I awas being paid six thousand naira on monthly basis.
It kept on going on and on until i got admission into university. Meanwhile my mum was already married to another man he is Igala by tribe from kogi state. 
to cut the long story short, she had a son with him and also was a worker holic. She was not so lucky with marriage.but she was resilent and hardworking becausse she has a target and knows what to do to get better and richer in life,
She got a job with the federal government of nigeria, her location was in lagos state which was also in close proximity to the house,
she became rich and well to do. I forgot to tell you that the second man she got married too was a replica of my dad he was rich also but never cared for his wife whatwsoever the only thing he does was to buy fleet of cars and also party hard his child's schoool was not an imporant priority to him.<br> he prefers to be out there crusing with the latest babes in town 
to cut the long story short. my mom bought a plot of land built a house and also ensure that the house was well funished to her taste. A car was okay for her  so she enjoyed every bit of her life. She became a financially free woman as she had a lot of businesses and also was very comfortable.

<h1> Backwords reading</h1>

<p>Reading words from right to left, brings out the creativity in you. You can be able to hide words from people. <br> It takes a patient person to be able to read through what you have written and that way, <br> you can be able to keep your secrets. Below is <em>a little story written backwords</em> lets see if you can read and understand. It is called <strong>Bi-dimentional overriding.</strong></strong> </p>

<hr>
<bdo dir="rtl">Once upon a time, there lived a girl called Zainab, she was hard working and loving above all, she was a very beautiful girl without manners. She could cook, wash, clean the house but she lacked manners of approach. One day, she went to the stream to fetch water to cook and an old woman asked her to assist her cross the river. Guess what? Zainab ignores her and told her never to distract her or tell her anything again. The old woman wept zainab left her in the stream. Unfortunately for zainab, she was strucked by thunder and a cobra bit her and she died. Manners of approach goes a long way. You may be hardworking but when ever you lack it, people will certainly judge you to be a terrible person because you could not address them properly. I hope you learn how to treat people better";</bdo>
